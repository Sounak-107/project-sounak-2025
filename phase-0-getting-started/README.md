## ✅ What We Did in Phase 0

### 1. 🎯 Project Setup

- Created the **official GitHub repository**: [project-ultimate-path-to-IoT-Ecosystem](https://github.com/Sounak-107/project-ultimate-path-to-IoT-Ecosystem)
- Structured it for phase-wise documentation and code management

### 2. 🎨 Branding and Identity

- Generated a **unique digital logo** representing the fusion of tech and innovation
- Added branding to the GitHub repository
